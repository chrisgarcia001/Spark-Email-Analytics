# Spark Email Analytics

This repo contains scripts for performing different types of searching and analysis on email data sets.
These run in Spark to enable scaling to larger data sets. A few demo files and data are also included
mainly for testing. The sample data came from the publicly-available Enron email data set. The full dataset
can be obtained [here.](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7E./enron/enron_mail_20150507.tgz)
